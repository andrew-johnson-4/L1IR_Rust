# L1IR Rust
AoT compilation to Rust for [L1IR](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/L1IR) code.

### Why LSTS and L1?

LSTS has a type system and syntax that innovates on logical structuring and destructuring of values vis-Ã -vis types.

Writing the equivalent code directly in Rust is bulky, inefficient, and error-prone.

So we find the happy medium: compile L1 to Rust, then use the exposed L1 functions as a Rust library.

Very little wagered. Much to gain. Everybody is happy: maybe.
